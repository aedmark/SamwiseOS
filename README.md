Can you help design a roadmap for our great migration to python on this project?# SamwiseOS



### A GPT-centric operating system



This project is an exploration into creating a unique operating system where the primary interface is a generative AI.







## What is this?



SamwiseOS is a web-based operating system designed from the ground up to be AI-first. Instead of a traditional GUI or a simple command line, the user interacts with the system through a conversation with an AI. The AI can understand complex commands, create and manage files, and even write and execute code on behalf of the user. The entire OS is a single-page application that runs in your browser.



## Why?



The goal is to explore a new paradigm for human-computer interaction. What if, instead of learning complex commands or navigating menus, you could simply tell your computer what you want to do in natural language? This project is a testbed for that idea, pushing the boundaries of what's possible with in-browser AI and WebAssembly.



## Current Status



This project is a work-in-progress, but it has come a long way! We are in the middle of a migration to make the entire operating system fully self-contained and capable of running offline.



-   **Python Kernel:** The core of the OS is a robust Python kernel that runs entirely in the browser thanks to the magic of **Pyodide**.

-   **Offline First:** We've successfully moved from a CDN-based Pyodide to a locally hosted distribution. The OS can now run without an internet connection! The final steps of this migration are still in progress.

-   **Virtual File System:** A fully functional virtual file system (VFS) is implemented, allowing for file and directory manipulation.

-   **Local Persistence:** The file system state is saved to the browser's local storage, so your work persists between sessions.

-   **Rich Command Set:** We have a growing list of standard POSIX-like commands (e.g., `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `mkdir`) and custom AI-powered commands.

-   **GUI Applications:** It's not just a terminal! SamwiseOS supports GUI applications like a text editor (`edit`), file explorer (`explore`), and even a paint program (`paint`).



## Features



* **AI-Powered Shell:** Interact with the OS using natural language.

* **Python Backend, JS Frontend:** A powerful combination running entirely in the browser.

* **Self-Contained:** All dependencies, including the Python runtime and packages, are bundled with the app.

* **Persistent File System:** Your files and directory structure are saved locally.

* **Extensible Commands:** Easily add new commands in Python or JavaScript.

* **GUI Apps:** Run graphical applications within the OS environment.

* **User and Group Management:** Basic multi-user support with `sudo` capabilities.



## How to Run



1.  **Clone the repository.**

2.  **Download Pyodide:**

    * Go to the [Pyodide releases page](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/releases).

    * Download the `pyodide-v0.25.1-full.tar.bz2` file.

    * Extract the contents and copy them into the `dist/pyodide/` directory. (Follow the instructions in `dist/pyodide/README.md`).

3.  **Run a local web server** in the project's root directory. A simple way to do this is with Python:

    ```bash

    python -m http.server

    ```

4.  Open your browser and navigate to the server's address (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
