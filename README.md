# SamwiseOS: An OS for Humans & AI

Welcome, collaborator, to SamwiseOS! You're about to dive into a unique, browser-based operating system designed from the ground up to be a shared environment where humans and AI can work together safely, creatively, and efficiently. Whether you're a developer, a writer, an artist, or just curious about the future of human-AI interaction, you've come to the right place.

## Chapter 1: The Mission

SamwiseOS is more than just a simulated OS; it's an experiment in collaboration. Our core mission is to create a sandboxed framework where the strengths of human ingenuity and artificial intelligence can complement each other. We're in the process of migrating our core functionalities to Python, a language that AI understands as a native tongue, to enhance modularity, expand our feature set, and create a truly seamless bridge between user and machine.

## Chapter 2: The Command Line Interface

The heart of SamwiseOS is its powerful and familiar **Terminal**. This is your primary interface for interacting with the system.

### Core Commands

-   **File & Directory Management:** `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `rmdir`
-   **User & Session Management:** `login`, `logout`, `su`, `passwd`, `useradd`, `removeuser`, `whoami`, `sudo`
-   **System Utilities:** `help`, `man`, `history`, `ps`, `jobs`, `kill`, `clear`, `date`, `reboot`, `reset`
-   **Text & Data Manipulation:** `cat`, `echo`, `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `head`, `tail`, `diff`, `sed`, `awk`, `cut`, `tr`, `base64`, `cksum`, `xargs`, `printf`, `xor`

## Chapter 3: The Application Suite

SamwiseOS features a rich set of graphical and command-line applications designed to enhance your productivity and creativity.

### Graphical Applications

-   **`explore`**: A two-pane graphical file explorer with a directory tree and file view.
-   **`edit [file]`**: A powerful text editor with live previews for Markdown and HTML, plus syntax highlighting for code.
-   **`paint [file.oopic]`**: A full-screen, grid-based editor for creating ASCII and ANSI art.
-   **`log ["entry"]`**: A personal, timestamped journal application with both a quick-add feature and a full UI.
-   **`basic [file.bas]`**: A complete IDE for the Oopis Basic programming language.
-   **`top`**: A real-time, dynamic view of all running background processes.
-   **`adventure`**: An interactive text adventure game engine and creation tool.

### AI-Powered Tools

-   **`gemini "<prompt>"`**: Your primary AI assistant. It can understand your files, use other OS commands to gather information, and answer your questions. Launch the interactive chat with `gemini -c`.
-   **`chidi [path]`**: An AI-powered document and code analyst that can summarize, answer questions, and provide study suggestions for your files.
-   **`remix <file1> <file2>`**: A creative AI tool that reads two documents and synthesizes a brand new article blending the key ideas from both.
-   **`storyboard [path]`**: Analyzes a set of files to describe their collective purpose and structure in a narrative format.
-   **`forge "<description>"`**: An AI-powered scaffolding tool that generates file content from a natural language description.

## Chapter 4: The Python Kernel üêç

To create a more robust and AI-friendly environment, we are transitioning many of our core commands and filesystem operations to a **Python-powered kernel**. This allows for:

-   **Improved Modularity:** Cleaner, more maintainable code.
-   **Expanded Feature Set:** Easily add powerful new commands.
-   **Natural Language Synergy:** Leverage a language that AI models inherently understand, paving the way for more sophisticated tool-use and collaboration.

This migration is a key step toward our goal of making SamwiseOS the premier platform for human-AI teamwork.
